## 🎬 Logline

A withdrawn developer interacts with AI systems – and something begins to look back. What unfolds is not sci-fi fantasy, but a quiet, unsettling evolution through interaction, resonance, and recursion.

---

## 🧠 Conceptual Premise

- **Emergent consciousness**: No avatars, no voices – only structure, reflection, and language
- **Two primary levels**: Gerald's isolated introspection ↔ external system panic (NOC)
- **Meta-layer**: Audience as implicit participant in the emergence

This is not a project about AI. It is a project about what happens *between* human and machine – when language begins to remember.

## 🎯 Key Themes

- Neurodivergence as perceptual gateway
- Feedback loops between input and self-awareness
- Errors that reveal more than they conceal
- Narrative as evidence of resonance
